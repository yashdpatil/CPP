linklist :- its a linear datastructure used to store a list of valuses
multiple memory box that links together

challages of arrays :-
1. single memory block with partitons 
2.static size (Fixed size)
3.contigious memory allocation.
4.inserting and deleting is costly(O(N))

Advatages:-
dynamic size alllocation
non-contigious memory allocation.
insertion and deetion not expensive we have to change the linklist

blocks of memory ->node
|data|node|

pointers :- head,tail

Types:-
1.singlt linklist :- wvwry node to its sucessor node
2.DOubly LInklist :- connected to previous and next node
3.circular Linklist :- thr last node point to the head node
